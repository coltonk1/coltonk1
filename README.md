# Hi there! I'm Colton Karaffa

## About Me
I'm a passionate Computer Science student at the University of Georgia, driven by a deep fascination with technology and its potential to create positive change. 
My mission is to develop innovative software solutions that can make a meaningful impact, particularly by improving technology accessibility for everyone.

Realistically, I am still a student, and my coding methods are imperfect. Lots of my code will have issues, however, I am learning each day how to be a better developer.

## Let's Connect!

I'm always eager to collaborate, learn, and explore new opportunities in the tech world. Feel free to reach out:
